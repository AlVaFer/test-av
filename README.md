## Author notes

IMPORTANT: 

***************************

In order to use the service Cors Anywhere actually we need to visit [https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/corsdemo](https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/corsdemo) and click on the "Request temporary access to the demo server" button to temporarily init or restore the full functionality of CORS Anywhere for your client only.

***************************


This project is a Single Page Application programmed in React and presents three screens: In the main screen you can watch a list of the 100 most popular Apple podcasts, also you can filter them using the textbox and see in a badge the count of results. The second screen is a detail page of the selected podcast and a list of its tracks. The third is a detail page of the selected track and here you can listen the audio of the podcast and read about its content.

Almost each component has been styled with a different technique (sass, styled components, mui, bootstrap, etc). The design of the screens are responsive.

The deploy offers two possible modes: optimized and minified or not minified-optimized. 

I have made tests and documentation with JSDoc for some components. You can read it opening the file documents/index.html downloading the whole documents folder.

* **components**: React components. 
* **components/children**: Children components.
* **components/hooks.jsx**: React custom hooks used by the components or by its pages. If several components need the hook it would be saved in a main hook folder but is wasn't necessary in this project.
