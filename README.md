## Author notes

IMPORTANT: 

***************************

In order to use the service Cors Anywhere actually we need to visit [https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/](https://cors-anywhere-herokuapp.com) and click on the "Request temporary access to the demo server" button to temporarily init or restore the full functionality of CORS Anywhere for your client only.

***************************


This project is a Single Page Application programmed in React and is divided in three screens: In the main screen you can watch a list of the 100 most popular Apple podcasts. The second one is a detail page of each podcast and a list of the tracks. The third is a detail page of each track and here you can listen the audio of the podcast and read about its content.

Almost each component has been styled with a different technique (sass, styled components, mui, bootstrap, etc). The design of the screens are responsive.

The deploy offers two possible modes: optimized and minified or not minified-optimized. 

I've made documentation with JSDoc for some components. You can read it opening the file documents/index.html or in [https://github.com/AlVaFer/test-av/blob/master/documents/index.html/](DOCUMENTS).
